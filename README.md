> In the rapidly evolving landscape of machine learning and its real-world applications, a notable project has emerged on GitHub: GPT Researcher. This autonomous system functions as an advanced research assistant, drawing from the capabilities of AutoGPT and Plan-and-Solve to offer a unique approach to online research. One of its most promising applications is in the field of web scraping, a technique for extracting data from websites, where Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT Researcher offer significant advantages.

> EasyGUI is a module for very simple, very easy GUI programming in Python. EasyGUI is different from other GUI generators in that EasyGUI is NOT event-driven. Instead, all GUI interactions are invoked by simple function calls.<br>
> EasyGui provides an easy-to-use interface for simple GUI interaction with a user. It does not require the programmer to know anything about tkinter, frames, widgets, callbacks or lambda.<br>
> EasyGUI runs on Python 2 and 3, and does not have any dependencies.

> As we shared in our research paper last month, Meta Chameleon is a family of models that can combine text and images as input and output any combination of text and images with a single unified architecture for both encoding and decoding. While most current late-fusion models use diffusion-based learning, Meta Chameleon uses tokenization for text and images. This enables a more unified approach and makes the model easier to design, maintain, and scale. The possibilities are endless—imagine generating creative captions for images or using a mix of text prompts and images to create an entirely new scene.<br.

>Building open-domain chatbots is a challenging area for machine learning research. While prior work has shown that scaling neural models in the number of parameters and the size of the data they are trained on gives improved results, we show that other ingredients are important for a high-performing chatbot. Good conversation requires a number of skills that an expert conversationalist blends in a seamless way: providing engaging talking points and listening to their partners, both asking and answering questions, and displaying knowledge, empathy and personality appropriately, depending on the situation. We show that large scale models can learn these skills when given appropriate training data and choice of generation strategy. We build variants of these recipes with 90M, 2.7B and 9.4B parameter neural models, and make our models and code publicly available. Human evaluations show our best models are superior to existing approaches in multi-turn dialogue in terms of engagingness and humanness measurements. We then discuss the limitations of this work by analyzing failure cases of our models.
