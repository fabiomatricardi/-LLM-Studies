üìù Isaac Asimov | Biography & Facts | Britannica
Isaac Asimov turned from science fiction to concentrate more on nonfiction writing in the late 1950s. From 1958 to 1991 he wrote a monthly column about science for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which received a special Hugo Award in 1963. His writing explored various topics in chemistry, physics, and biology.Isaac Asimov is best known for the Foundation series and robot stories. The Foundation stories were written between 1942 and 1949 and were collected as the Foundation trilogy: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), and Second Foundation (1953). In 1940 Asimov had begun writing his robot stories, which were collected in I, Robot (1950).During World War II Isaac Asimov worked at the Naval Aviation Experimental Station in Philadelphia along with science-fiction authors Robert A. Heinlein and L. Sprague de Camp. Asimov had begun contributing stories to science-fiction magazines in 1939. He sold his first story, ‚ÄúMarooned off Vesta,‚Äù to Amazing Stories. It appeared in the March 1939 issue.Isaac Asimov (born January 2, 1920, Petrovichi, Russia‚Äîdied April 6, 1992, New York, New York, U.S.) was an American author and biochemist, a highly successful and prolific writer of science fiction and of science books for the layperson. He wrote or edited about 500 volumes, of which the most famous are those in the Foundation and robot series.Asimov was brought to the United States at age three. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from Columbia University in 1939. During World War II, he worked at the Naval Aviation Experimental Station in Philadelphia along with science-fiction authors Robert Heinlein and L. Sprague de Camp. After the war, he took a Ph.D. in chemistry from Columbia in 1948. He then joined the faculty of Boston University, with which he remained associated thereafter.Britannica Quiz Science Fiction Writers QuizAsimov, Isaac Isaac Asimov, postage stamp from Djibouti, c. 2010. (more) cover of Foundation Cover of the first edition of Isaac Asimov's novel Foundation (1951). (more)Asimov began contributing stories to science-fiction magazines in 1939. He sold his first story, ‚ÄúMarooned off Vesta‚Äù to Amazing Stories, but he was most closely associated with Astounding Science-Fiction and its editor, John W. Campbell, Jr., who became a mentor to Asimov. ‚ÄúNightfall‚Äù (1941), about a planet in a multiple-star system that only experiences darkness for one night every 2,049 years, brought him to the front rank of science-fiction writers and is regarded as one of the genre‚Äôs greatest short stories.In 1940 Asimov began writing his robot stories (later collected in I, Robot [1950]). In the 21st century, ‚Äúpositronic‚Äù robots operate according to the Three Laws of Robotics:A robot may not injure a human being , or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; and a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.By developing (with Campbell) a set of ethics for robots and rejecting previous conceptions of them as marauding metal monsters, Asimov greatly influenced other writers‚Äô treatment of the subject.‚ÄúThe Encyclopedists‚Äù (1942) was the beginning of Asimov‚Äôs popular Foundation series. Loosely modeled on the fall of the Roman Empire, the Foundation series begins in the last days of the Galactic Empire. Hari Seldon devises a discipline, ‚Äúpsychohistory,‚Äù that allows prediction of future historical currents. He sets into motion a plan to reduce the predicted 30,000-year galactic dark ages to 1,000 years by gathering the brightest minds on the planet Terminus to form the Foundation of a new Galactic Empire. Seldon also establishes a mysterious Second Foundation in an unknown location. The Foundation struggles to keep civilization alive, while, at moments of acute crisis predicted by psychohistory, recordings of the long-dead Seldon dispense advice. The stories, written between 1942 and 1949, were collected as the Foundation trilogy: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952), and Second Foundation (1953). The trilogy won a special Hugo Award in 1966 for best science-fiction series of all time.Get a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content. Subscribe NowAsimov‚Äôs first novels (Pebble in the Sky [1950], The Stars, Like Dust [1951], and The Currents of Space [1952]) were set during and before the Galactic Empire but had no relation to the Foundation series. Under the pseudonym Paul French, he wrote the children‚Äôs Lucky Starr series (1952‚Äì58), each volume of which took place on a different world of the solar system. He returned to the positronic robots with two novels that blended mystery with science fiction. Three thousand years hence, humanity is divided between those who live on Earth in overpopulated underground cities and the wealthy Spacers, who live on worlds around nearby stars. The human policeman Lije Baley and the Spacer ‚Äúhumaniform‚Äù robot detective R. Daneel Olivaw solve murders in New York City in The Caves of Steel (1954) and on a Spacer planet in The Naked Sun (1957). During the 1950s, Asimov also wrote some of his finest short stories: ‚ÄúThe Martian Way‚Äù (1952), an allegory about McCarthyism; ‚ÄúThe Dead Past‚Äù (1956), about a device that can see into history; and ‚ÄúThe Ugly Little Boy‚Äù (1958, original title ‚ÄúLastborn‚Äù), about a nurse‚Äôs attachment to a Neanderthal child accidentally brought forward to the future.In the late 1950s, Asimov turned from science fiction to concentrate more on nonfiction writing. From 1958 to 1991, he wrote a monthly column about science for The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, which received a special Hugo Award in 1963. Much of his nonfiction writing was on various topics in science, written with lucidity and humour, ranging from chemistry (The Chemicals of Life [(1954]) to physics (The Neutrino [1975]) to biology (The Human Brain [(1964]). He even wrote on literature (Asimov‚Äôs Guide to Shakespeare, 2 vol. [1970]) and religion (Asimov‚Äôs Guide to the Bible, 2 vol. [1968‚Äì69]).Asimov returned to science fiction with The Gods Themselves (1972, winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards) concerned contact with advanced aliens from a parallel universe. ‚ÄúThe Bicentennial Man‚Äù (1976, Hugo and Nebula for best novelette), about a robot‚Äôs quest to become human is one of Asimov‚Äôs most beloved short stories.In the 1980s Asimov tied together the robot, Empire, and Foundation series in the same fictional universe. The characters in Foundation‚Äôs Edge (1982, Hugo Award for best novel) begin to suspect that a third, concealed power has emerged in the galaxy that is even more powerful than the two Foundations. Baley and Olivaw reunited in The Robots of Dawn (1983), in which they investigate the destruction of a robot identical to Olivaw. In Robots and Empire (1985), set 200 years after Baley‚Äôs death, Olivaw battles a threat to humanity that culminates in the diaspora from Earth that leads to the galactic Empire. Foundation and Earth (1986) centers on a search for the forgotten planet Earth and how its early history as depicted in the robot series affected the galaxy‚Äôs history. Two prequels to the Foundation trilogy, Prelude to Foundation (1988) and Forward the Foundation (1993), Asimov‚Äôs final novel, follow Hari Seldon‚Äôs development of psychohistory and the Foundation plan.Among Asimov‚Äôs late novels were expansions of previous short stories, written with Robert Silverberg, such as Nightfall (1990) and Child of Time (1991, based on ‚ÄúThe Ugly Little Boy‚Äù). He published three volumes of autobiography: In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920‚Äì1954 (1979); In Joy Still Felt: .The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954‚Äì1978 (1980); and I, Asimov: A Memoir (1994, Hugo Award for best nonfiction book).

üìù Isaac Asimov short stories bibliography - Wikipedia
This is a list of short stories by American writer Isaac Asimov. Asimov is principally known for his science fiction, but he also wrote mystery and fantasy stories.This list includes Asimov's Foundation short stories, which were later collected into three novels known as the Foundation Trilogy.Published stories [ edit ]In this table, "year" refers to the year of publication, and in the case of magazines means the cover date (which is not always the year when the magazine actually appeared on sale). Alternative titles appear in brackets. (383 stories appear on this list.)The collection I, Robot also contains a linking text at the beginning and end of the book, and in between some (but not all) of the stories, which form a framing story not found anywhere else.[citation needed]A play by Asimov called The Story Machine, which is an adaptation of his short story "Someday", was published in the February 1958 issue of Plays.[7]In 1950 Asimov wrote a comic strip called "Star Empire" (art by Charles Schneeman). The first page appeared in the May 1990 issue of Argosy.[8][9][10][11]Stories never anthologised [ edit ]Five published stories were never included in Asimov's own books. They were however included in other anthologies. These were "Half-Baked Publisher's Delight" (1974), "Getting Even" (1980), "The Turning Point" (1988), "The Lost Dog" (1988) and "Ho! Ho! Ho!" (1989).Nine science fiction stories have never been collected in any book:20 mystery stories have also never been anthologised.[24][25] Of these, all but one are Union Club mystery stories[24] (for a list, see The Union Club Mysteries). "Zip Code" (1986) is a mystery story featuring the boy detective character Larry.[26]Unpublished stories [ edit ]Nine stories which Asimov wrote early in his career were never published anywhere, and are now lost.[27] They were:In the 1972 anthology The Early Asimov, Asimov listed two other stories which he thought had also been lost:[35] "The Weapon" (1938) and "Big Game" (1941). However, they were subsequently found ("The Weapon" had in fact been published under a pseudonym in 1942, which Asimov had forgotten). They were collected in In Memory Yet Green (1979) and Before the Golden Age (1974), respectively.[36][37] (They are included in the above list of published stories.)In his autobiography, Asimov wrote "Since February 1941, I have never written a piece of fiction that has not, in one way or another, seen print."[38]See also [ edit ]

üìù How H.G. Wells predicted Oppenheimer and atomic bombs - Big Think
Excerpted from Human Extinction: A History of the Science and Ethics of Annihilation by √âmile P. Torres, ¬© 2023 by Routledge. Reproduced by permission of Taylor & Francis Group.Let‚Äôs begin with a brief account of how nuclear weapons were developed. Frederick Soddy and Ernest Rutherford discovered that radioactive decay involves the transmutation of one type of atom into another, which led to worries about a ‚Äúplanetary chain reaction‚Äù of infectious decay that converts the chemical mosaic of Earth‚Äôs elements into helium. In the process, a huge amount of energy would be liberated, according to the equation E = mc2, which led some to speculate about the causes of nova observed in the firmament. Later, in 1934, Irene and Fr√©d√©ric Joliot-Curie figured out how to convert certain stable atoms into radioactive atoms, by which time the notion of ‚Äúatomic energy‚Äù had inspired a profusion of utopian and dystopian proclamations about its potential to usher in a post-scarcity world or tear the planet asunder.A notable example that combined both themes was H.G. Wells‚Äô 1914 novel The World Set Free, which was written the previous year and dedicated to Soddy‚Äôs work on radium. This book describes a catastrophic world war (initiated by Germany in the 1950s, as it happens) that ultimately leads to the creation of a harmonious world state. What is most relevant for our purposes is that the war involves what Wells called, coining the term, ‚Äúatomic bombs‚Äù that pilots fling from their cockpits on urban centers below, destroying entire cities. However, these are not like the ‚Äúatomic bombs‚Äù dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945; rather than producing a sudden massive explosion, they utilize a fictional radioactive element called ‚ÄúCarolinum‚Äù to generate ‚Äúa blazing continual explosion‚Äù that ‚Äúis never entirely exhausted,‚Äù and which would create ‚Äúpuffs of luminous, radio-active vapour drifting sometimes scores of miles from the bomb centre and killing and scorching all they overtook.‚ÄùAlthough this was science fiction, the idea greatly influenced one of the pioneers of nuclear weapons: a young Hungarian physicist named Le√≥ Szil√°rd, who read The World Set Free in 1932 and included Wells within his circle of acquaintances. As the now-famous story goes, Szil√°rd read an article in The Times the following year that quoted Rutherford as saying that ‚Äúanyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine.‚Äù The reason is that, as another newspaper article on Rutherford‚Äôs talk explained, ‚Äúwalls of electric energy surround the nucleus. To break down wall after wall and eventually reach the holy of holies [i.e., the nucleus] in which almost incredible energy is concentrated, the physicist must lay siege to the atom. So he tries to batter it and blast it apart‚Äù by shooting alpha particles at the nuclei. The problem is that only ‚Äúone particle in 10,000,000 strikes the nucleus,‚Äù meaning that the process is extremely inefficient (quoting here a New York Times article published the same day on Rutherford‚Äôs comments).Finding himself ‚Äúirritated‚Äù by Rutherford‚Äôs confidence Szil√°rd went for a walk and, standing at a street corner in London, devised a method for unlocking the vast stores of energy trapped in atomic nuclei: a nuclear chain reaction. Whereas earlier experiments had involved alpha particles, which consist of two protons and neutrons (the latter of which were first discovered in 1932), Szil√°rd instead imagined bombarding atoms with free neutrons, which unlike alpha particles have a neutral rather than positive charge. This would enable them to easily trespass the aforementioned ‚Äúwalls of electric energy,‚Äù thus striking a greater number of nuclei. Furthermore, Szil√°rd reasoned that if an atom struck by a free neutron were to subsequently release two additional neutrons, the process ‚Äî the chain reaction ‚Äî could become exponential and self-sustaining. Over just a few millionths of a second, billions of atoms could be struck by and release neutrons, thereby liberating enormous quantities of energy at once rather than (as with natural radioactive decay) over protracted stretches of time. Szil√°rd quickly realized that, as he later wrote, ‚Äúin certain circumstances it might become possible to set up a nuclear chain reaction, liberate energy on an industrial scale, and construct atomic bombs.‚ÄùThis was the abstract idea, but could it work? Are there elements whose atoms release two neutrons when struck by one? If so, which elements? An important step toward answering these questions came in 1938 with the discovery of nuclear fission in uranium atoms by a team of scientists in Berlin, the capital of Nazi Germany, which found that irradiating uranium with neutrons causes the atoms to split into fragments. Upon hearing about this the following year, Szil√°rd, in his words, ‚Äúsaw immediately that these fragments‚Ä¶ must emit neutrons, and if enough neutrons are emitted in this fission process, then it should be, of course, possible to sustain a chain reaction. All the things which H.G. Wells predicted,‚Äù he continued, ‚Äúappeared suddenly real to me.‚Äù Now the crucial question became, ‚ÄúIs this actually the case? Does uranium fission produce neutrons and, if so, how many?‚ÄùFlashes appearing on the oscillograph‚Äôs display screen would indicate that uranium does indeed produce neutrons.To answer the first question ‚Äî to confirm his suspicions ‚Äî Szil√°rd conducted an experiment with his colleague Walter Zinn in March of 1939. It involved using a cathode-ray oscillograph to track the movements and kinetic energy of neutrons that might be released by uranium atoms when split by slow neutrons striking them. Flashes appearing on the oscillograph‚Äôs display screen would indicate that uranium does indeed produce neutrons, which ‚Äúin turn would mean that the large-scale liberation of atomic energy was just around the corner.‚Äù After initiating the experiment, Szil√°rd and Zinn were relieved that no flashes appeared, although they soon realized that the screen had been unplugged. Once the screen was powered on, the two scientists ‚Äúturned the switch and saw the flashes,‚Äù Szil√°rd later recalled. ‚ÄúWe watched them for a little while and then we switched everything off and went home,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThat night, there was very little doubt in my mind that the world was headed for grief.‚ÄùHaving spent much of the 1930s anxious that atomic energy ‚Äî more accurately called nuclear energy ‚Äî could be weaponized to produce ‚Äúatomic bombs,‚Äù Szil√°rd scheduled a meeting with Einstein in a Peconic, Long Island cottage where Einstein was staying. Szil√°rd explained how nuclear energy could be unlocked and turned into a bomb, to which Einstein reportedly said, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt thought of that at all.‚Äù Worried that the world was on the brink of another war and that Nazi Germany might develop an atomic bomb, Szil√°rd penned a letter ‚Äî now called the ‚ÄúEinstein-Szil√°rd letter‚Äù ‚Äî intended for U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt to alert him of the danger. He noted that ‚Äúsome of the American work on uranium is now being repeated‚Äù at a Berlin-based university with connections to the German Under-Secretary of State, and that Nazi ‚ÄúGermany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from‚Ä¶ the German Under-Secretary of State,‚Äù and that ‚ÄúGermany has actually stopped the sale of uranium from the Czechoslovakian mines which she has taken over.‚ÄùThis letter, whose only signatory was Einstein, spurred the creation of the Manhattan Project, described by some as the first ‚ÄúBig Science‚Äù project in history, which aimed to design, build, and test the first atomic bombs. It cost $2 billion USD ($23 billion in 2018 dollars) and involved more than 130,000 scientists, although only a handful were aware of the project‚Äôs details and ultimate goals. The research arm of the endeavor, based in the top-secret Los Alamos Laboratory near Santa Fe, New Mexico, was run by the physicist, child prodigy, and chainsmoker (an incredible four to five packs per day) Robert Oppenheimer, known today as the ‚ÄúFather of the Atomic Bomb.‚ÄùThe first atomic bomb, nicknamed the ‚ÄúGadget,‚Äù was detonated at 5:29 in the morning on July 16, 1945, in the desert of Jornada del Muerto, sometimes translated as ‚ÄúJourney of the Dead Man,‚Äù in New Mexico. This was the Trinity test, which created a burst of smoke and fire that rapidly rose 40,000 feet into the early morning sky. Less than a month later, on the 6th and 9th of August, the United States dropped two atomic bombs ‚Äî Little Boy, a uranium bomb, and Fat Man, a plutonium bomb ‚Äî on the Japanese archipelago, killing more than 100,000 people and helping, some argue, to bring World War II to an end.

üìù 'Oppenheimer' True Story: All About the Real Events That Inspired the ...
Christoper Nolan's behemoth film Oppenheimer is finally available to stream at home. The movie stars Cillian Murphy as the title character, renowned and notorious physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer.Oppenheimer is most remembered as the ‚Äúfather of the atomic bomb‚Äù and was the physicist in charge of the Manhattan Project, the name given to the top-secret project that developed the weapons the United States used to devastate the Japanese cities Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. His path toward the creation of the bomb was etched in his childhood when Oppenheimer proved to be scientifically gifted and advanced far beyond his years.As a reticent and thoughtful man, Oppenheimer didn‚Äôt always share his inner workings freely. He spoke out about the gravity of the atomic bomb following the two detonations, and in later years openly opposed the development of the hydrogen bomb for use against the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The latter choice meant he was investigated as a Communist sympathizer, a charge Oppenheimer denied.Oppenheimer, which earned a Golden Globe for best motion picture and several Oscar nominations, is available to stream exclusively on Peacock.Here is what to know about the real events that inspired the Christopher Nolan film.Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?Alpha Historica / AlamyJulius Robert Oppenheimer was brought into the Manhattan Project soon after it began in 1942. While President Roosevelt expressed some hesitation, the U.S. launched the project to explore building an atomic bomb during World War II.As shared by the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Oppenheimer, already a renowned theoretical physicist at the time, served as the director of the Los Alamos Laboratory throughout the project. He was eventually nicknamed the ‚Äúfather of the atomic bomb‚Äù after being put in charge of both the research and design of the devastating weapon.Oppenheimer was born on April 22, 1904, and gained a reputation for academic giftedness early in his life. By the time he was 10 years old, Oppenheimer was studying physics and chemistry. At 12 years old, the New York Mineralogical Club asked him to speak at the group‚Äôs meeting without realizing he was not yet a teen. He graduated from Harvard University at the age of 22 after finishing his degree in three years.Oppenheimer eventually went to Europe to study at the University of Cambridge and later at the University of G√∂ttingen's Institute for Theoretical Physics. Though a scene in Oppenheimer shows the young theoretical physicist poisoning an apple on his Cambridge professor's desk with potassium cyanide only to correct his mistake the following day, Oppenheimer's grandson Charles told TIME the incident is untrue. "There's no record of him trying to kill somebody," Charles told the publication. "That's a really serious accusation and it's historical revision. There's not a single enemy or friend of Robert Oppenheimer who heard that during his life and considered it to be true."Oppenheimer went on to receive a Ph.D. degree under Max Born, a physicist who helped develop the theory of quantum mechanics. He returned to the United States and began working as an advisor at the Atomic Energy Commission following World War I. He also taught at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1929 to 1943.In October 1942, Oppenheimer was put in charge of what was then known as Project Y, a laboratory that focused on researching weapon physics. He served as director of the Los Alamos facility from 1943 to 1945 before resigning.Did J. Robert Oppenheimer have a family?PictureLux / The Hollywood Archive / AlamyOppenheimer married biologist Katharine "Kitty" Oppenheimer (n√©e Puening) in 1940. Kitty (portrayed by Emily Blunt) had been married three times prior: She annulled her first marriage in 1933; her second husband ‚Äî who was a Communist Party member ‚Äî died during the Spanish Civil War; and she was married to her third husband, Richard Harrison, when she met Oppenheimer.Kitty and Oppenheimer welcomed two children together: son Peter in 1941 and daughter Katherine "Toni" in 1944.According to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, Kitty also worked at the Los Alamos facility for a short period of time and was well-known for the dinner parties she threw for the other wives of scientists at the facility. She was Oppenheimer‚Äôs first and most important confidant in all matters of his life. Kitty also struggled with alcoholism and depression, especially following Oppenheimer's death in 1967. She died in 1972 in Panama City, Panama, after suffering a pulmonary embolism.Prior to meeting Kitty, Oppenheimer was involved with psychiatrist and American Communist Party member Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh). The two met in 1936, though Tatlock ended their relationship in 1939. However, Oppenheimer and Tatlock rekindled their romance during his marriage to Kitty, with the physicist even visiting Tatlock in San Francisco as late as 1943. Tatlock died in January 1944.What did J. Robert Oppenheimer invent?Pictorial Press Ltd / AlamyOppenheimer primarily worked in theoretical physics and made a number of contributions to the field. While he is known for the development of the atomic bomb, the physicist was also responsible for the development of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which is a mathematical approximation in molecular dynamicsHis work is also credited with predicting later findings by other scientists, such as the neutron, meson and neutron star, in addition to a number of theoretical contributions.What was the Manhattan Project?Science History Images / AlamyIn 1939, scientists around the world learned that Nazi Germany‚Äôs scientists had learned how to split a uranium atom. The process is known as nuclear fission and requires a neutron to collide with a uranium atom, which in turn releases an amount of energy that can have devastating consequences. As such, the news appropriately alarmed scientists around the world, especially if it meant the Nazis would develop their own atomic weapons.Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), who fled Nazi Germany, and physicist Leo Slizard each took steps to speak to President Roosevelt about the gravity of the situation and to encourage Roosevelt to develop a program in the United States so that scientists could work toward developing their own project. The U.S. government launched the Manhattan Project in 1942, though Einstein was not involved in the military and scientific project. According to the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, the project was originally headquartered in New York City, hence the name, and led by Lieutenant General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon).From there, two secret nuclear facilities were constructed in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, as well as a laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer was head of research. While 120,000 people worked at the Manhattan Project, only a handful knew the true goal of the work they were contributing to.Known as the Trinity test, the first atomic bomb was tested on July 16, 1945, in the Jornada del Muerto desert ‚Äî more than 200 miles south of Los Alamos. Oppenheimer chose the code name Trinity inspired by the poetry of John Donne. The results were a shock to everyone involved; homes 100 miles away could reportedly feel the explosion and a mushroom cloud ballooned about eight miles into the sky.Following the Trinity test, Oppenheimer later recalled, "A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent." He also famously said that a line from the Hindu scripture Bhagavad-Gita came to mind: ‚ÄúNow, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.‚ÄùWhat did J. Robert Oppenheimer think of the atomic bomb?Prisma by Dukas Presseagentur GmbH / AlamyIt seems as though Oppenheimer believed in his work, including the work that led up to the ultimate detonation of atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. In the 2012 book Robert Oppenheimer: A Life Inside the Center, author Jay Monk wrote that on Aug. 6, 1945, (when the first bomb was dropped), Oppenheimer and his fellow scientists seemed victorious.As the book describes, ‚ÄúTo ecstatic cheering, Oppenheimer told the crowd that it was too early to say what the results of the bombing had been, but that ‚Äòthe Japanese didn‚Äôt like it.‚Äô ‚Äù Monk added Oppenheimer's only regret was that "we hadn't developed the bomb in time to use it against the Germans."The second bomb devastated Nagasaki, Japan, on Aug. 9, 1945. Monk also wrote that President Truman and Oppenheimer were not involved in the decision to deploy the weapon, as a previous directive issued on July 24 of the same year had already authorized General Spaatz to drop subsequent atomic bombs ‚Äúas soon as made ready by the project staff.‚Äù The following day, President Truman issued an order to stop atomic bombings.It does not seem that Oppenheimer was proud of or happy about the deployment of the second bomb. Monk wrote that an FBI report stated the physicist was a ‚Äúnervous wreck‚Äù following the events of Aug. 9, and was also described as being ‚Äúreluctant to promise that much real good could come out of continuing atomic-bomb work.‚ÄùWhat did J. Robert Oppenheimer say after the nuclear explosions in 1945?Science History Images / AlamyOppenheimer left his post at the Los Alamos facility in November 1945. In his farewell speech, which the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History has since shared in full, Oppenheimer admitted that the initial reason the team built the bomb was that it was believed using a weapon of that nature might be the only way to win World War II. Once it became clear that the war could be won without using atomic weapons, he said, a different motivation kicked in.As Oppenheimer put it, ‚ÄúSome people, I think, were motivated by curiosity, and rightly so; and some by a sense of adventure, and rightly so. Others had more political arguments and said, ‚ÄòWell, we know that atomic weapons are in principle possible, and it is not right that the threat of their unrealized possibility should hang over the world. It is right that the world should know what can be done in their field and deal with it.‚Äô ‚ÄùUltimately, Oppenheimer seemed resolute on a number of issues, including the fact that with the detonation of two atomic bombs, the world had to contend with a new problem. He said, ‚ÄúI think it is true to say that atomic weapons are a peril which affect everyone in the world, and in that sense a completely common problem, as common a problem as it was for the Allies to defeat the Nazis. I think that in order to handle this common problem there must be a complete sense of community responsibility. I do not think that one may expect that people will contribute to the solution of the problem until they are aware of their ability to take part in the solution.‚ÄùWas J. Robert Oppenheimer a Communist?SuperStock / AlamyThe years that followed the detonation of two atomic bombs were politically fraught in the United States. Oppenheimer was named Chairman of the General Advisory Committee for the Atomic Energy Commission, and in this capacity, argued against the development of a hydrogen bomb.At the time, the United States was well into the Cold War with the Soviet Union, and Oppenheimer‚Äôs recommendation against creating a hydrogen bomb was seen as politically dubious. As the Institute for Advanced Study noted, the physicist was soon caught up in McCarthyism and investigated by the U.S. government.In December 1953, then-Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission (and foe of Oppenheimer) Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.) informed the physicist that his security clearance had been suspended due to his alleged ties to the Communist Party and urged Oppenheimer to quit. (Oppenheimer's mistress Tatlock was a known member of the Communist Party, as well as his brother Frank Oppenheimer and sister-in-law Jackie. Oppenheimer had also been under investigation while teaching at Berkeley and during the Manhattan Project.)Rather than step down, Oppenheimer requested a hearing into the matter, which began in April 1954 and lasted for four weeks. Several of Oppenheimer's former colleagues testified against him, including Edward Teller (Benny Safdie). Ultimately, Oppenheimer lost his security clearance and was eventually stripped of his title.In 1962, President Kennedy asked Oppenheimer to come to the White House, where he received an apology for what happened. He received the Enrico Fermi Award for his scientific achievements one year later.And in 2022, United States Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm nullified the AEC's decision, saying, ‚Äúmore evidence has come to light of the bias and unfairness of the process that Dr. Oppenheimer was subjected to while the evidence of his loyalty and love of country have only been further affirmed," per The New York Times.How did J. Robert Oppenheimer die?Everett Collection Historical / AlamyOppenheimer died from throat cancer on Feb. 18, 1967.

üìù Introducing Claude 3.5 Sonnet \ Anthropic
Today, we‚Äôre launching Claude 3.5 Sonnet‚Äîour first release in the forthcoming Claude 3.5 model family. Claude 3.5 Sonnet raises the industry bar for intelligence, outperforming competitor models and Claude 3 Opus on a wide range of evaluations, with the speed and cost of our mid-tier model, Claude 3 Sonnet.Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for free on Claude.ai and the Claude iOS app, while Claude Pro and Team plan subscribers can access it with significantly higher rate limits. It is also available via the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud‚Äôs Vertex AI. The model costs $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens, with a 200K token context window.Frontier intelligence at 2x the speedClaude 3.5 Sonnet sets new industry benchmarks for graduate-level reasoning (GPQA), undergraduate-level knowledge (MMLU), and coding proficiency (HumanEval). It shows marked improvement in grasping nuance, humor, and complex instructions, and is exceptional at writing high-quality content with a natural, relatable tone.Claude 3.5 Sonnet operates at twice the speed of Claude 3 Opus. This performance boost, combined with cost-effective pricing, makes Claude 3.5 Sonnet ideal for complex tasks such as context-sensitive customer support and orchestrating multi-step workflows.In an internal agentic coding evaluation, Claude 3.5 Sonnet solved 64% of problems, outperforming Claude 3 Opus which solved 38%. Our evaluation tests the model‚Äôs ability to fix a bug or add functionality to an open source codebase, given a natural language description of the desired improvement. When instructed and provided with the relevant tools, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can independently write, edit, and execute code with sophisticated reasoning and troubleshooting capabilities. It handles code translations with ease, making it particularly effective for updating legacy applications and migrating codebases.State-of-the-art visionClaude 3.5 Sonnet is our strongest vision model yet, surpassing Claude 3 Opus on standard vision benchmarks. These step-change improvements are most noticeable for tasks that require visual reasoning, like interpreting charts and graphs. Claude 3.5 Sonnet can also accurately transcribe text from imperfect images‚Äîa core capability for retail, logistics, and financial services, where AI may glean more insights from an image, graphic or illustration than from text alone.Artifacts‚Äîa new way to use ClaudeToday, we‚Äôre also introducing Artifacts on Claude.ai, a new feature that expands how users can interact with Claude. When a user asks Claude to generate content like code snippets, text documents, or website designs, these Artifacts appear in a dedicated window alongside their conversation. This creates a dynamic workspace where they can see, edit, and build upon Claude‚Äôs creations in real-time, seamlessly integrating AI-generated content into their projects and workflows.This preview feature marks Claude‚Äôs evolution from a conversational AI to a collaborative work environment. It‚Äôs just the beginning of a broader vision for Claude.ai, which will soon expand to support team collaboration. In the near future, teams‚Äîand eventually entire organizations‚Äîwill be able to securely centralize their knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared space, with Claude serving as an on-demand teammate.Commitment to safety and privacyOur models are subjected to rigorous testing and have been trained to reduce misuse. Despite Claude 3.5 Sonnet‚Äôs leap in intelligence, our red teaming assessments have concluded that Claude 3.5 Sonnet remains at ASL-2. More details can be found in the model card addendum.As part of our commitment to safety and transparency, we‚Äôve engaged with external experts to test and refine the safety mechanisms within this latest model. We recently provided Claude 3.5 Sonnet to the UK‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (UK AISI) for pre-deployment safety evaluation. The UK AISI completed tests of 3.5 Sonnet and shared their results with the US AI Safety Institute (US AISI) as part of a Memorandum of Understanding, made possible by the partnership between the US and UK AISIs announced earlier this year.We have integrated policy feedback from outside subject matter experts to ensure that our evaluations are robust and take into account new trends in abuse. This engagement has helped our teams scale up our ability to evaluate 3.5 Sonnet against various types of misuse. For example, we used feedback from child safety experts at Thorn to update our classifiers and fine-tune our models.One of the core constitutional principles that guides our AI model development is privacy. We do not train our generative models on user-submitted data unless a user gives us explicit permission to do so. To date we have not used any customer or user-submitted data to train our generative models.Coming soonOur aim is to substantially improve the tradeoff curve between intelligence, speed, and cost every few months. To complete the Claude 3.5 model family, we‚Äôll be releasing Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Opus later this year.In addition to working on our next-generation model family, we are developing new modalities and features to support more use cases for businesses, including integrations with enterprise applications. Our team is also exploring features like Memory, which will enable Claude to remember a user‚Äôs preferences and interaction history as specified, making their experience even more personalized and efficient.We‚Äôre constantly working to improve Claude and love hearing from our users. You can submit feedback on Claude 3.5 Sonnet directly in-product to inform our development roadmap and help our teams to improve your experience. As always, we look forward to seeing what you build, create, and discover with Claude.

üìù Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Anthropic's AI model is competing with GPT-4o and ...
The AI arms race continues apace: Anthropic is launching its newest model, called Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which it says can equal or better OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o or Google‚Äôs Gemini across a wide variety of tasks. The new model is already available to Claude users on the web and on iOS, and Anthropic is making it available to developers as well.Claude 3.5 Sonnet will ultimately be the middle model in the lineup ‚Äî Anthropic uses the name Haiku for its smallest model, Sonnet for the mainstream middle option, and Opus for its highest-end model. (The names are weird, but every AI company seems to be naming things in their own special weird ways, so we‚Äôll let it slide.) But the company says 3.5 Sonnet outperforms 3 Opus, and its benchmarks show it does so by a pretty wide margin. The new model is also apparently twice as fast as the previous one, which might be an even bigger deal.AI model benchmarks should always be taken with a grain of salt; there are a lot of them, it‚Äôs easy to pick and choose the ones that make you look good, and the models and products are changing so fast that nobody seems to have a lead for very long. That said, Claude 3.5 Sonnet does look impressive: it outscored GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Meta‚Äôs Llama 3 400B in seven of nine overall benchmarks and four out of five vision benchmarks. Again, don‚Äôt read too much into that, but it does seem that Anthropic has built a legitimate competitor in this space.Claude 3.5‚Äôs benchmark scores do look impressive ‚Äî but these things change so fast. Image: AnthropicWhat does all that actually amount to? Anthropic says Claude 3.5 Sonnet will be far better at writing and translating code, handling multistep workflows, interpreting charts and graphs, and transcribing text from images. This new and improved Claude is also apparently better at understanding humor and can write in a much more human way.Along with the new model, Anthropic is also introducing a new feature called Artifacts. With Artifacts, you‚Äôll be able to see and interact with the results of your Claude requests: if you ask the model to design something for you, it can now show you what it looks like and let you edit it right in the app. If Claude writes you an email, you can edit the email in the Claude app instead of having to copy it to a text editor. It‚Äôs a small feature, but a clever one ‚Äî these AI tools need to become more than simple chatbots, and features like Artifacts just give the app more to do.The new Artifacts feature is a hint at what a post-chatbot Claude might look like. Image: AnthropicArtifacts actually seems to be a signal of the long-term vision for Claude. Anthropic has long said it is mostly focused on businesses (even as it hires consumer tech folks like Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger) and said in its press release announcing Claude 3.5 Sonnet that it plans to turn Claude into a tool for companies to ‚Äúsecurely centralize their knowledge, documents, and ongoing work in one shared space.‚Äù That sounds more like Notion or Slack than ChatGPT, with Anthropic‚Äôs models at the center of the whole system.
